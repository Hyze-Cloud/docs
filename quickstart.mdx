This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your first application using the HyzeCloud API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1.  A HyzeCloud account.
2.  Your API credentials.
3.  An application ready to deploy (as a ZIP file).

## Step 1: Authentication

First, you need to authenticate with the API. You can sign up using email/password or use a social provider.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/auth/sign-in/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "your-email@example.com",
    "password": "your-password"
  }'
```

This will return a session cookie that you must include in subsequent requests.

## Step 2: Prepare Your Application

Package your application code into a ZIP file. Ensure your `package.json` (for Node/Bun) or `requirements.txt` (for Python) is in the root of the ZIP.

## Step 3: Deploy Your App

Use the `/api/apps` endpoint to deploy your application.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/apps \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/app.zip" \
  -F "name=my-first-app" \
  -F "runtime=node" \
  -F "memoryMB=512" \
  -F "startupCommand=npm start"
```

## Step 4: Monitor Deployment

You can check the status of your application using the ID returned from the deploy command.

```bash
curl https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/apps/{appId}
```

Once the status is `running`, your application is live!
