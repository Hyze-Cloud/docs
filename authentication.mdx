HyzeCloud uses cookie-based authentication for secure API access.

## Methods

We support multiple authentication methods:

- **Email & Password**: Traditional sign-up and sign-in.
- **OAuth (Social)**: Google and GitHub authentication.

## Session Management

When you successfully authenticate, the API sets a `better-auth.session_token` cookie. You must include this cookie in all subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

### Sign Up

To create a new account:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/auth/sign-up/email 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Sign In

To log in to an existing account:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/auth/sign-in/email 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securePassword123"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### Sign Out

To end your session:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/auth/sign-out
```
</CodeGroup>

## User Profile

You can retrieve the currently authenticated user's profile and session information using the `/api/auth/get-session` endpoint.
