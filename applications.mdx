Applications are the core of HyzeCloud. Each application runs in its own isolated container with specified resources.

## Creating an Application

To create an application, you upload a ZIP file containing your source code. You must also specify the runtime environment and resource limits.

### Supported Runtimes

- **Node.js**: `node`
- **Bun**: `bun`
- **Python**: `python`

### Resource Limits

You can configure the memory allocation for your container, from 128MB up to 2048MB.

## Managing Lifecycle

You can control the state of your application using the following actions:

- **Start**: Boot up a stopped container.
- **Stop**: Gracefully shut down a running container.
- **Restart**: Reboot the container (useful after configuration changes).

## Environment Variables

Securely manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials using environment variables. These are injected into your container at runtime.

```bash Example
curl -X PUT https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/apps/{appId}/env 
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d '{
    "envVars": {
      "DATABASE_URL": "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db",
      "API_KEY": "secret_key"
    }
  }'
```

## Logs

Access real-time logs to debug and monitor your application's performance. You can fetch the latest logs or stream them.

```bash Example
curl https://api.hyzecloud.com/api/apps/{appId}/logs?tail=100
```
